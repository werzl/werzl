Hi! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm A Bachelor of Computer Science, and Full-Stack Cloud Developer.<br/>
<br/>
I love problem solving, and when I'm not swearing at my PC because my lambda function won't deploy, or furiously debugging code at 2am, I wake up every day loving what I do. I have a real passion for JavaScript, Node, ES6 and React. I'd love to contribute to some open source projects where I can learn and collaborate on these!
